# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies examining real, theoretical, speculative, and extreme
engineering ideas related to planetary cooling and climate modification.

The **Space Radiator** project evaluates whether large-scale thermal radiators,
placed in space or coupled to Venus’s atmosphere, could remove enough heat to
meaningfully cool the planet.

This project operates fully within **known physics**. No violations of
conservation laws, no fantasy mechanisms, and no catastrophic interventions are
assumed. All conclusions follow from established thermodynamics and radiative
heat transfer.

Despite this, the concept is treated as an **extreme engineering thought
experiment**. The scales of area, mass, and time required exceed any realistic
engineering capability and are analyzed as such.

This repository is **not**:
- A proposal for construction
- A megastructure design specification
- An advocacy document for planetary modification
- A claim of feasibility

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that even the most physically
reasonable cooling mechanism—radiation into space—becomes impractical when
applied to a planetary heat reservoir.

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, analysis, and presentation** of
this work as an educational and comparative study.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or

This repository exists to test a simple idea honestly:

> *If heat naturally radiates into space, how much radiator do you actually need
> to cool a planet?*
