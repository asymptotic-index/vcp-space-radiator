# Scale Comparisons
Space Radiator — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides **scale comparisons** to make the magnitude of the Space
Radiator concept intuitive. Radiative cooling feels gentle and reasonable at
human scale; these comparisons show how it explodes at planetary scale.

All values are order-of-magnitude and illustrative.

## Radiator Area vs Planetary Scale

Venus surface area:

A_venus ≈ 4.6 × 10¹⁴ m²

Required radiator area (solar balance only):

- 300 K radiators:  
  A ≈ 3.5 × 10¹⁴ m²  
  ≈ **0.75× Venus’s entire surface area**

- 400 K radiators:  
  A ≈ 1.1 × 10¹⁴ m²  
  ≈ **¼ of Venus’s surface area**

This ignores stored heat removal.

## Stored Heat Removal Comparison

Atmospheric thermal energy:

E_atm ≈ 1.6 × 10²⁶ J

If radiators remove an *extra* 1 × 10¹⁵ W beyond solar balance:

- Time required ≈ **5,000 years**

This assumes uninterrupted operation.

## Comparison to Human Energy Infrastructure

Total human power production today:

≈ 18 TW

Required radiator throughput:

- Hundreds to thousands of TW
- Sustained for millennia

This exceeds global civilization-scale energy flows by orders of magnitude.

---

## Mass Intuition (Absurd but Grounded)

Assume an optimistic radiator mass density:

- 1 kg/m² (extremely light)

At 300 K radiator area:

- Total mass ≈ **3.5 × 10¹⁴ kg**

That is comparable to:
- ~350 billion metric tons
- Many times the mass of all structures ever built by humans

---

## Human Running Equivalent (Illustrative)

Energy per kilometer of running (75 kg person):

E_run ≈ 3.1 × 10⁵ J/km

Atmospheric heat equivalent:

- ≈ **5 × 10²⁰ km of running**
- ≈ **50 billion light-years**

Radiation is gentle, but totals are brutal.

---

## Time Intuition

Radiative cooling trades:
- Violence for patience
- Speed for area

At planetary scale, patience must be measured in millennia.

## Summary

> Space Radiator fails quietly,  
> but at incomprehensible scale.

The physics works. The numbers do not.
