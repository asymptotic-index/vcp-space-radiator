# Assumptions
Space Radiator — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** used throughout the Space
Radiator analysis. These assumptions are intentionally optimistic to establish
**lower-bound requirements** for feasibility.

If the concept fails under these assumptions, it cannot succeed under more
realistic ones.

---

## Radiator Assumptions

Radiators are assumed to be:

- Perfectly deployable at arbitrary scale
- Structurally stable regardless of size
- Long-lived and maintenance-free
- High-emissivity (ε ≈ 1)
- Oriented optimally at all times

Material limits, mass, and manufacturing constraints are ignored.

---

## Thermal Coupling Assumptions

It is assumed that:

- Heat can be transferred efficiently from Venus to radiators
- No bottlenecks exist in conduction or transport
- Thermal losses during transfer are negligible

These assumptions strongly favor success.

---

## Temperature Assumptions

- Radiators operate at a constant, chosen temperature
- No degradation of emissivity occurs
- No overheating or thermal runaway limits apply

Radiator temperature is treated as a controllable parameter.

---

## Planetary Assumptions

Baseline Venus properties:

- Atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  
- Mean surface temperature: ~737 K  
- Solar flux at Venus: ~2,613 W/m²  

These values remain constant unless directly altered by cooling.

---

## Energy Balance Assumptions

- Incoming solar energy continues uninterrupted
- Greenhouse trapping persists unless atmosphere is altered
- Radiators must overcome net energy input, not just stored heat

No passive stabilization mechanisms are assumed.

---

## Temporal Assumptions

- Radiators operate continuously
- Cooling is evaluated over centuries to millennia
- Short-term perturbations are ignored

---

## Ethical and Interpretive Assumptions

- Analysis does not imply endorsement
- Results are interpreted conservatively
- Extreme scale does not justify extreme action

---

## Summary

> These assumptions give Space Radiator every possible advantage.

Even so, radiator area and time requirements remain enormous.
