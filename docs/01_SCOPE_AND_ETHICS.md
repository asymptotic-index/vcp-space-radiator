# Scope and Ethics
Space Radiator — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **scope**, **intent**, and **ethical framing** of the
Space Radiator project. Because this concept stays within known physics, it is
important to clearly state what is being evaluated—and what is not being
advocated.

---

## Project Scope

Space Radiator examines the following question:

> Can large-scale thermal radiators in space remove heat from Venus fast enough
> to meaningfully reduce planetary temperature?

The analysis focuses on:
- Radiative heat transfer limits
- Required radiator surface area
- Energy flow and timescales
- Order-of-magnitude feasibility

All calculations use established thermodynamics and radiation laws.

---

## What Is Included

This project includes:
- Idealized radiator assumptions
- Optimistic coupling to Venus’s heat sources
- Long-duration, continuous operation models
- Simplified geometry to expose scale limits

Optimism is used intentionally to establish **lower bounds**.

---

## Out of Scope

This project does **not**:
- Design actual radiator structures
- Address launch, assembly, or maintenance logistics
- Evaluate political, legal, or governance issues
- Argue that Venus should be modified

Engineering feasibility is intentionally abstracted away.

---

## Ethical Framing

Even non-destructive planetary modification raises ethical questions. This
project adopts the following posture:

- **Non-advocacy:**  
  The project does not argue that Venus should be cooled.

- **Transparency:**  
  All assumptions and limitations are explicitly stated.

- **Educational intent:**  
  The goal is to build intuition about planetary energy scale.

- **Respect for science:**  
  Physics is treated as constraint, not obstacle.

## Responsibility in Framing

Space Radiator is often cited as a “reasonable” solution in speculative
discussions. This project exists to evaluate that reasonableness quantitatively,
without exaggeration or dismissal.

---

## Summary

> This project asks a simple question carefully,  
> not a dramatic question loosely.

Ethical clarity ensures the results inform understanding rather than inspire
misuse.
