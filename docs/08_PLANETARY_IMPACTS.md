# Planetary Impacts
Space Radiator — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document evaluates the **planetary-scale impacts** of operating Space
Radiators over extended periods. Unlike impulsive concepts, Space Radiator acts
slowly, making long-term system response the dominant concern.

---

## Impact on Surface Temperature

If Space Radiators operate continuously and exceed net solar input:

- Surface temperatures decrease gradually
- Cooling rates are slow and asymptotic
- Early gains are larger than later ones

Deep cooling becomes progressively harder as temperature drops.

---

## Impact on Atmospheric Structure

As temperatures decrease:
- Atmospheric scale height contracts
- Pressure gradients adjust
- Cloud layers may shift altitude

These changes are gradual and do not inherently accelerate cooling.

---

## Impact on Greenhouse Effect

Space Radiators do **not** alter atmospheric composition.

As a result:
- Greenhouse trapping remains
- Infrared opacity persists
- Radiators must compensate indefinitely

Cooling does not become self-sustaining.

---

## Impact on Planetary Energy Balance

Radiators introduce a new external heat-loss channel.

However:
- This channel must remain active continuously
- Any interruption halts progress
- Equilibrium reasserts itself quickly

Space Radiator does not establish a stable passive state.

## Impact on Long-Term Climate Evolution

Over millennia:
- Radiators can shift equilibrium temperature slightly
- Significant climate transformation requires extreme duration
- Geological processes remain largely unaffected

Radiators modify, but do not reset, Venus’s climate trajectory.

---

## Comparative Perspective

Relative to other Venus Cooling Project concepts:
- Space Radiator is the least destructive
- It is also among the slowest
- Scale dominance remains decisive

---

## Summary

> Space Radiator changes Venus slowly,  
> and only while it operates.

Planetary impacts are modest relative to effort expended.
