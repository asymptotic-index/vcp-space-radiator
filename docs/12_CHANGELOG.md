Space Radiator — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Versioning Scheme

This project uses a simplified semantic versioning model:

- **MAJOR** — Conceptual scope change or reframing
- **MINOR** — New analytical coverage or comparative extensions
- **PATCH** — Clarifications, corrections, formatting, or math cleanup

## Change Log

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release
- Defined Space Radiator as a physics-respecting, extreme engineering concept
- Evaluated radiative heat transfer limits using Stefan–Boltzmann law
- Quantified required radiator area to offset Venus’s solar input
- Compared radiator temperatures against surface area scaling
- Analyzed atmospheric thermal inertia and greenhouse persistence
- Identified dominant failure modes driven by area and timescale
- Provided planetary-scale and human-scale comparisons
- Included glossary, appendix, and foundational scientific references

## Notes

Space Radiator is intentionally conservative in its assumptions.  
Future updates may refine numerical estimates, explore alternative geometries, or
add comparative context, without altering the core conclusion:

> Radiative cooling works—but only at planetary, multi-millennial scale.
