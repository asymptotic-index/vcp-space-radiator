## Purpose

This document provides a **reference guide** for terminology, symbols, constants,
and shorthand used throughout the Space Radiator repository.

It exists to reduce friction for readers and centralize commonly referenced
values. No new arguments are introduced here.

## Glossary — Core Concepts

### Space Radiator (Project Definition)
A large-area thermal system designed to radiate heat from Venus into space using
infrared emission governed by blackbody radiation laws.

---

### Radiative Heat Transfer
The transfer of energy via electromagnetic radiation, independent of physical
contact or material medium.

---

### Stefan–Boltzmann Law
A physical law stating that the total power radiated per unit area of a blackbody
is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.

P = σT⁴

---

### Emissivity (ε)
A dimensionless factor (0–1) describing how efficiently a surface emits thermal
radiation relative to an ideal blackbody.

---

### Energy Balance
The accounting of all energy entering, leaving, and stored within a system. Long-
term temperature is governed by balance, not instantaneous flows.

---

### Thermal Inertia
The resistance of a system to temperature change due to stored heat energy.

---

### View Factor
A geometric term describing how much radiation emitted by one surface reaches
another. Critical in orbital radiator configurations.

## Notes on Interpretation

- Values are order-of-magnitude unless stated otherwise
- SI units are used throughout
- Radiative systems scale nonlinearly with temperature
- Area dominates feasibility

This appendix exists to keep intuition anchored to numbers.
